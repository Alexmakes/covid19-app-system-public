# Virology Testing API

API group: [Submission](../guidebook.md#system-apis-and-interfaces)

The Virology Testing API is provides HTTP endpoints to retrieve URLs and tokens for the interaction with the virology testing website and to enable retrieving test results later.

Virology tokens follow the [Crockford and Damm](../../design/details/crockford-damm.md) algorithm.

Please note: testResult INDETERMINATE reported by Fiorano will be delivered as VOID to the mobile application - the behaviour could change in the future.

## Endpoints for mobile app

### URLs and HTTP verbs

- Order a home kit test: ```[POST] https://<FQDN>/virology-test/home-kit/order```
- Register home kit test (alias for order): ```[POST] https://<FQDN>/virology-test/home-kit/register``` 
- Poll for test results: ```[POST] https://<FQDN>/virology-test/results```
- Obtaining a test result in exchange for a cta token that was not generated by the mobile application: ```[POST] https://<FQDN>/virology-test/cta-exchange```

## Payload Examples

### Response for ordering a home kit test / registering a home kit test

```POST https://<FQDN>/virology-test/home-kit/order```

```POST https://<FQDN>/virology-test/home-kit/register```

Request body: empty

Response body:
```json
{
    "websiteUrlWithQuery": "https://self-referral.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/cta-start?ctaToken=tbdfjaj0",
    "tokenParameterValue": "tbdfjaj0",
    "testResultPollingToken" : "61EEFD4B-E903-4294-B595-B1D491134E3D",
    "diagnosisKeySubmissionToken": "6B162698-ADC5-47AF-8790-71ACF770FFAF" 
}
```
Notes: `tokenParameterValue` is only to be displayed in the app. See bellow for more info about the `testResultPollingToken` and `diagnosisKeySubmissionToken` fields. 

### Poll for test result using the token from the ordering requests

```POST https://<FQDN>/virology-test/results```

Request body:
```json
{
    "testResultPollingToken": "61EEFD4B-E903-4294-B595-B1D491134E3D"
}
```

Response body:
```json
{
    "testEndDate": "2020-04-23T00:00:00Z",
    "testResult": "POSITIVE"
}
```
or
```json
{
    "testEndDate": "2020-04-23T00:00:00Z",
    "testResult": "NEGATIVE"
}
```
or
```json
{
    "testEndDate": "2020-04-23T00:00:00Z",
    "testResult": "VOID"
}
```

### Obtaining a test result in exchange for a cta token that was not generated by the mobile application

- Security: This endpoint will be made slow (response time) by design to avoid brute-force attacks.

```POST https://<FQDN>/virology-test/cta-exchange```

Request body:
```json
{
    "ctaToken": "1234abcd"
}
```

Response body:
```json
{
    "diagnosisKeySubmissionToken": "6B162698-ADC5-47AF-8790-71ACF770FFAF",
    "testEndDate": "2020-04-23T00:00:00Z",
    "testResult": "POSITIVE"
}
```
Notes: See [diagnosis-key-submission.md](diagnosis-key-submission.md) for more info about the `diagnosisKeySubmissionToken` field.
